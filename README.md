# Driver-alert-system-based-on-eye-recognition
 Car accident is the major cause of death in which  million of people die. To prevent such accidents we propose a system which alerts the driver if the driver feels drowsy.
# install all libarys 
 - scipy  (pip install scipy)
     - SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. Here we are using scipy module to compute the Euclidean distance between facial landmarks points in the eye aspect ratio calculation.

- OpenCv
  - openCv for computer vision

- numpy (pip install numpy)
  - numpy for basic processing and calcutions ...

- imutils (pip install imutils)
   - We’ll also need the imutils package, my series of computer vision and image processing functions to make working with OpenCV easier.

-  pyglet (pip install pyglet)
    - we'll also need pyglet  playing sound such as .mp3 , .wav ...  

-  dlib
   - To detect and localize facial landmarks we’ll need the dlib library
